        About Me
    </h3>
    <p>
        My journey in Software Engineering started when I was in High school and I took a small coding class. The class showed me two things I would have never learned on my own. It taught me that I was exceptional at reading and solving expressions and that I enjoyed finding the mistakes I had made. After high school, I traveled across many different paths of the workforce ranging from being a Pharmacy Technician to working with the youth of tomorrow. It is now through my studies that I am back on the road I once pictured. After graduation I plan on continuing my learning through apprenticeships and projects to stand out from the crowd.
